      Welcome to the Mayanja Memorial Hospital Foundation web portal, 
The name Mayanja was derived from the name of my Father the Late Martin Luther Mayanja who had left a will compelling the founder Dr Mugerwa Benon to set up a Hospital and name it Mayanja Memorial Hospital, the hospital was to provide health services .The hospital was finally established in 2003, by Dr Mugerwa Benon, his wife Barbra Mugerwa and the Board of Directors. It had to operate on a private basis. Soon after in 2004, the Foundation started and called Mayanja Memorial Hospital Foundation (MMHF) operating as a Community Based Organization .In the same year, became   a registered Non Governmental Organization. MMHF since its inception focused on Improving Health Outreach Programs and increased awareness of the Masses Living within South Western Uganda.<br />
The Foundation has implemented programs on HIV/AIDS responses and awareness, Maternal Health Rights, Improving response to services of the Orphaned and Vulnerable populations. As the MMHF, we have managed to achieve a number of goals in terms of Health services creation of awareness in the Communities.<br />
Therefore, this Web based Communication system will assist in disseminating information, creating awareness and strengthening Response of Health services within our operational areas and the whole World at large.
I extend my gratitude to the staff, Board of Directors and Development partners for the support extended as far as achievements of the Foundation are concerned.

<img class="imgindent" src="img/starsw.png" height="165" width="700" />
<hr />
This is a 5 year USAID funded project. The project was awarded in May 2010 to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) in partnership with, Uganda Health Marketing Group (UHMG) and Mayanja Memorial Hospital Foundation (MMHF). In this partnership, Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation EGPAF the prime partner is responsible for the overall leadership and management of the STAR-SW project and serves as the technical lead for HIV/AIDS care and treatment, PMTCT, and systems strengthening, implements TB-HIV integration, laboratory strengthening and facility-based HCT activities. Uganda Health Marketing Group implements demand generation activities for HIV/AIDS and TB services in the community. Mayanja Memorial Hospital Foundation provides strategic connections to VHTs, CSOs, CBOs and other community-level groups and works with the clinical services team to support community HCT, CB-DOTS for TB and home-based care (HBC) activities and provides strategic linkages to civil society organizations (CSO).
<br />
<br />
<div class="example1">
<div class="down">
<div class="highlite1">Project Goal</div>
To increase access to, coverage of and utilization of quality comprehensive TB and HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment services within district health facilities and their respective communities in 13 districts of South Western Uganda.
<br /><br />
<div class="highlite1">Project Objectives/Result Areas</div>

1.	 Increase uptake of comprehensive HIV/AIDs and TB services within 9 districts in South -West Uganda.<br />
2.	Strengthen decentralized service delivery systems for improved uptake of quality HIV/AIDS and TB services.<br />
3.	Strengthen decentralized service delivery systems for improved uptake of quality HIV/AIDS and TB services<br />
4.	 Establish or strengthen linkages and referral systems within and between health facilities and communities<br />
<br /><br />
<div class="highlite1"> Project Coverage</div>
The project covers thirteen districts of Kisoro, Kabale, Kanungu, Rukungiri, Ntungamo, Busheyi, Isingiro, Kiruhura, Ibanda. Sheema, Mitooma, Rubirizi and Buhweju<br /><br />
<div class="highlite1"> Program Achievements</div>
i)	Assessment of referrals was conducted at 10 ART Health facilities. The assessment aimed at establishing how referrals are being recorded and who actually refers patients for health care services. All the health facilities assessed did not have files to keep the referral forms, no body at the facility was responsible for referrals and information on number of patients referred was not incorporated to guide planning. In order to improve facility based referrals, a facility based referral coordinating team was formed, files for keeping referral documents. It was recommended that seminars on referrals, linkages and networks should be conducted and communities must be mobilized to effect referrals.<br /><br />

ii)	CMEs on referrals were conducted at 25 ART health facilities. More than 997 health workers (480 males and 517 females) were reached with information. Quarterly facility based mentorship sessions followed up the CMEs. The health workers are now more equipped with knowledge and skilled how to hand referrals and have utilized the data for their planning. Health workers from HCIII within the catchment areas of targeted health sub district also benefited. The facilities were also supported with job aids on referrals.
<br /><br />
 
iii)	A total of 1112 VHTs (510 males and 602 females) were oriented on the program focused referral package (for services including SMC, ANC, HCT, PMTCT, EID and TB). The VHTs were also oriented on VHT referral tools and distributed to them. 
<br /><br />
iv)	A total of 4165 clients were referred to health facilities for services including ANC, HCT, SMC, delivery at the health units and TB services across the districts. The VHTs were given a range of services for which they could refer and their data then submitted to respective sub county health workers.<br />
 
3.4.0 Lessons learnt, Innovations and Best Practices
I.	Involvement of health based referral coordinating team and the sub county health worker led into improved management of referrals their respective health facilities. The coordinating unit consists of the in-charge, PMTCT focal person, TB focal person, VHT focal person, laboratory technician, 
II.	Planning using referral data has led to improvement on the required logistics and medical supplies and also planning to initiate community tailored interventions like instituting structures to support TB CDR and TSR through supporting VHT TB volunteers 
3.5.0 Implementation related Challenges
o	There is limited linkage between community social support groups/organizations and health facilities as noted in the interviews conducted. All health workers interacted with during the assessment reported that their health facilities were not referring clients to community organizations/groups and VHTs for continuing social support.
o	The practice of health workers on providing feedback to the VHTs after attending to the patients through filling part B of the referral form is still wanting.

e)	 District – has used the report to apply for recognition as an Approved Children's Home.<br />
<br />
<div class="highlite1"> Challenges and adapted solutions</div>

<div class="highlite">While implementing project activities during the reporting period a number of challenges were encountered:</div>

a)	Harmonization of the activities to be implemented by the TSO with what was proposed took longer than had been anticipated. 
 Consequently, the implementation momentum was slowed down.<br />
b)	The SDS funding modalities for the district activities took long to be communicated to districts hence posing a challenge during budgetary processes.<br />
c)	A number of programmes that require the same participants would happen at the same time. This pre-occupied the district officials who offered divided attention to the two programmes.<br />
d)	Programme introduced pilot parish community mapping which hitherto was not envisaged. This resulted in preoccupying the staff, time and other activities planned were rescheduled<br />
e)	The staffing of Community Based Services was noted as a challenge in the region. <br />
f)	Internet connectivity is a challenge in some districts.<br />
g)	Districts supported by SDS although they had received the grant, modalities of IFMS (Integrated Financial Management System) are delaying releases of funds to the implementing departments. <br />

 
<div class="highlite1"> Plans to address the challenges</div>
a)	Identifying and training paraprofessionals is paramount in addressing personnel gaps especially in the CBSD.  In addition the TSO will work with the CBSD to advocate for increased number of personnel in the CBSD.  
b)	Timely information and feedback from the relevant stakeholders is a prerequisite for planning and effective implementation.
c)	TSO will continue to strengthen capacity of HLGs, LLGs and CSOs to operate and manage the systems using user manual, tools and analysis of the data. The DOVCC OVC MIS technical working groups will be established, oriented on the system and followed up.
d)	In liaison with MGLSD the OVC-MIS data capture tool will be aligned to NSPPI-II to ease reporting.

  Project - Support Vulnerable Ugandan Youth Certify as Nurses - Global Giving</div>
  <hr />
I' am by names of <font class="highlite">ARINAITWE ANDRONAH</font>, an orphan who lost her parents to HIV-AIDS still a toddler, actually cannot visualize how they physically looked like. Support from an elderly Aunt whose income hard gone so low by the time of finishing primary and worsened by Ordinary level to less than 50 dollars a month. <br />

The scholarship scheme came as a God sent blessing at the verge of dropping out of the Institute and all my tuition and living expenses were covered. At the moment I have finished my course with good credits, my success is attributed to support received from global giving donors. This enabled me to have a settled mind and concentrate on my academics than worrying about tomorrow, thank you good hearted people.<br />

I have been employed by the blood bank Kabale branch as a nurse among my duties is phlebotomy ie collecting blood from the community in out reaches, open day blood donation, offering pre donation and post donation counseling to our clients. I also participate in data entry and analysis of patient information.<br />

Work is enjoyable and 'am overwhelmed by the fact that at the moment 'am employed and earn a salary to contribute to the well being of my little 3 siblings and medication for my elderly Aunt who adopted us.
Thank you Mayanja memorial Scholarship Fund for collaborating with good hearted people at Global Giving who have made a difference in our lives and the communities. <br />
